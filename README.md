# Braid Planning

The [GitHub Issues on this repo](https://www.github.com/braidchat/braid/issues) are used to track features and ideas for Braid, so that we don't overload the [main project's GitHub Issues](https://www.github.com/braidchat/braid/issues) (which are used for incoming bug reports, q&a, etc.)

Members of the core team use Asana for task management, so the [Issues](./issues) in this repo are synced with Asana using [Unito](https://www.unito.io).

If you would prefer to use Asana, please send an email to [raf@braidchat.com](raf@braidchat.com) and you'll be added ASAP.
